Stack Selection:

Core Frontend Framework: Next.js was chosen due to its robustness, ease of use, and its alignment with the project's requirement.
Language: TypeScript was used for its strong typing and ability to catch errors early in the development process.
State Management: Zustand was selected for its simplicity and minimal boilerplate code. Its API is straightforward, allowing for minimal boilerplate code, and it integrates seamlessly with TypeScript, ensuring type safety throughout the application. Zustand also avoids the complexity and performance overhead of more heavyweight state management libraries, making it an ideal choice for this project.
Styling: Tailwind CSS was chosen for its utility-first approach, which allows for rapid development and easy customization.
Component Library: NextUI was used for its pretty good looking set of pre-built components that integrate well with Tailwind CSS.


Thought Process:

Initial Development: Core Form Builder Component
The development began with creating the form builder component, which included only the minimum required fields. This allowed me to focus on the core functionality and ensure a solid foundation before introducing more complex features. Integrating the Zustand store at this stage enabled effective state management and interaction with the backend for CRUD operations.

Enhancing with Custom Fields
Building the custom fields feature was the next step. Here, I encountered variations in field names and data types, which led to challenges with interface definitions. To address this, I created a separate file for interfaces and exported them across different files, ensuring consistency and reusability throughout the application.

Building the "View All Forms" Page
Developing the "View All Forms" page involved displaying the form data and implementing various actions. Initially, I included actions for viewing, editing, and deleting forms. However, I later added actions for submitting form responses, viewing submissions, and showing all versions of a form, to provide a more comprehensive set of functionalities.

Reusable View Page Component
To ensure reusability, I developed the view page as a component. This decision allowed me to use the component for both displaying and filling out forms. Managing page overflow was a significant challenge, which involved calculating the chunks for a single page. Initially, I implemented a dynamic chunk calculation, but due to time constraints, I opted for a static chunk size. Although this approach wasn't ideal, it provided a temporary solution.

Prefilling Values and Confirmation Modals
For the edit functionality, I prefilled the form values before rendering, ensuring a smooth user experience. The delete action involved opening a confirmation modal to verify the user's intent, providing a secure way to handle deletions.

Submitting Form Responses
The submit form response feature reused the document preview page, allowing users to fill out and submit forms. Upon submission, the preview was uploaded to the form store, enabling users to review their submissions before finalizing them.

Viewing Submissions and Form Versions
The view submissions feature utilized the table component to display all submissions for a specific form version. The show all versions feature generated versions of a particular form, allowing users to create new versions with the same form ID but different version identifiers.

Final Touches: Navigation and Layout
To improve navigation, I built a fixed header navbar layout for all pages. The navbar included a button to submit responses, which opened the latest versions of all forms, and a button to view all forms, facilitating easy navigation across the application.

By combining the initial stages of development with strategic enhancements and thoughtful considerations for usability and state management, this approach highlights the iterative process of building a robust form builder application. The use of Zustand, the focus on reusable components, and the detailed handling of various features ensured a functional and user-friendly final product.
